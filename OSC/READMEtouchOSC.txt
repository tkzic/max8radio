Everything you could possibly know about touchOSC is at this site:
http://hexler.net/software/touchosc

The touchOSC screens are in the OSC folder. If there's more than one .osc file use the one with the highest number. For example, radio21.touchosc is newer than radio20.touchosc.

Max/MSP receives touchOSC data on 7400 and sends on port 7402. The format is UDP. These ports will need to be open if you have a firewall.
