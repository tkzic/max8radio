For the soft66lc2:

For MAC power pc architecture you'll need to install a new max external object (sfctrl.mxo) into the maxsdr5/ folder, to replace the existing sfctrl.mxo object.  I would recommend renaming the original one or copying it somewhere so you can get it back if you decide to use a modern Apple product.

You'll also need to install 3 .dylib files in /usr/local/lib. The same advice as above applies here too.

Unzip Lib PPC.zip and sfctrl.mxo.zip in the ppc/ folder to get the files.

For more detailed instructions on copying/installing library files so the READMElib.txt in the lib/ folder.
