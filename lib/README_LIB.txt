Soft66lc2 library files for max radio project:
----------------------------------------------
MacOS (For Windows see below)
----------------------------------------------
Several dynamic library files are required for the Soft66lc2 device control external object to load properly in Max/MSP.  If the Max radio patch loads and runs without errors, your computer already has the necessary library files installed. You can safely ignore these instructions.

On the other handâ€¦ if you load the max radio patch and see error messages in the Max window something like:

	sfctrl: unable to load object bundle executable
 	2011-11-11 15:51:06.328 MaxMSP[25680:507] Error loading /Users/tkzic/maxsdr5/sfctrl.mxo/Contents/MacOS/sfctrl:
	dlopen(/Users/tkzic/maxsdr5/sfctrl.mxo/Contents/MacOS/sfctrl, 262):
	Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libftdi.1.dylib
	Referenced from: /Users/tkzic/maxsdr5/sfctrl.mxo/Contents/MacOS/sfctrl	Reason: image not found

Then you've come to the right place. 

First - If your computer has the PPC (PowerPC) chipset there is now hope! The ppc/ folder has libraries, a special max external object and some instructions in ppc/READMEppc.txt,  Read the instructions and then come back here...

 
If your computer is Intel 32 or 64 bit, then you'll need to install libftdi on your computer. Libftdi is a library of USB drivers required by the Max external. There are two ways to get it. 

1) (the hard way) Install libraries by downloading and compiling source. Use instructions in this link:

	http://geckodownloads.googlecode.com/files/libftdimacosx.pdf


2) (the easy way) Just copy the library files from the maxsdr5/lib folder to the correct location on your computer using the instructions below. These libraries are 'fat' binaries and will work on both 32 & 64 bit architectures.

----------------------------------------------------------
Instructions for copying libftdi library files:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Short version: Copy all of the .dylib files in the maxsdr5/lib directory to: /usr/local/lib

Detailed version:

You'll be typing commands into the terminal console. Terminal is in the Applications/Utilities folder. You'll need your admin password for some of the commands. Just enter it when prompted.

1. See if /usr/local/lib exists. Type:

	ls -l /usr/local/lib

If the response is: "No such file or directory" then create it by typing:  

	sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib

2. To copy the files, first go the maxsdr5/lib folder. (assuming its under your home user folder - otherwise substitute correct folder location for "maxsdr5/lib")

	cd maxsdr5/lib

3. Then copy all the library files:

	sudo cp *.dylib /usr/local/lib

4. Now quit terminal. Return to Max/MSP and reload maxsdr5c.maxpat   

-------------
Windows (32 bit)
-------------
If you're using the soft66lc2 in Windows, you'll need to copy the ft2dxx.dll file from the lib/ folder to either one of two places:

	c:\windows\system32\

or	c:\ProgramFiles\Cycling'74\Max5.0\

The system may give you warnings about privileges - please ignore them and forge on through.

If you're running 64 bit Windows - please get in touch with me and I will try to come up with a new Max external.

If any of this doesn't work - or you have great ideas - please send email to radio@zerokidz.com
